## Interests

I am interested in understanding (i) how organs are sculpted and positioned within embryos and (ii) the molecular origin of forces acting between and within tissues to affect each other's behaviour during development. I study these in drosophila embryos. 

They say, seeing is believing. So, I love to work with images that give us ideas about protein/RNA localisation in cells/tissue and protein-protein interaction. I plan to base my career on images, whether I last in academia or decide to move to the industry. One of my aims is to also learn computational methods including machine learning to analyse images (I am only a beginner in ML, So anyone who is willing to learn and practice with publicly available datasets on similar research topics is most welcome to contact me).

## Education
I did my Bachelors's and Masters's in Biology from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune. My schooling was done in Chennai at DAV Girls Senior Secondary School, Gopalapuram.
